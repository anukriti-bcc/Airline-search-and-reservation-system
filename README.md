# Airline-search-and-reservation-system
C++ application using Dijkstra's algorithm and DFS to find the most time- and cost-efficient flights. Utilizes MySQL for authentication, reservations, and user profile management

CONCEPTS USED
● Data Structures: arrays, vectors, graphs (using adjacency matrix).
● Database Integration and Management
● Standard Library Functions and User-Invokable Functions
● Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path
● Backtracking
● DFS (Depth first Search) Traversal to find all possible paths
● Sorting Algorithms (Merge Sort)

Key Features:
1. User Authentication: Secure login and registration system for passengers/users.
2. Flight Search and Booking: to allow users to search for available flights and display flights
with shortest paths using Dijkstra and DFS Algorithms making it both time and
cost-friendly.
3. Reservation Management: to enable users to book, view or cancel existing bookings. The
platform also allows users to view their booking history.
4. Profile Management: to enable users to view, modify or delete their profiles without
hassle.
5. Data Persistence: The portal utilizes MySQL connectivity to maintain user information
and booking records in “flight_mgmt” database.
